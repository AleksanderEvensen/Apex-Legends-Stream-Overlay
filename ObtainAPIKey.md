# How to obtain a API key
1. Start by creating a account on the Tracker Network [HERE](https://thetrackernetwork.com/auth/register)

2. Then go to the Apex Tracker website and goto the [API Tab.](https://apex.tracker.gg/site-api)
   Click on the [Generate API Key])(https://apex.tracker.gg/site-api/create) link.


3. When you click the link you will be shown this page. I hope it's clear what you have to do on this page.
   but when your going to describe "What you are making" write about that your going to make an overlay for your stream. You may also
   mention your stream and what content you make.

4. When the form has been submitted it could take a while until you get your API key. When you get it will be displayed [here.](https://apex.tracker.gg/site-api)
   on the page you will see your api key and you only want the numbers and the letters not the "TRN-Api-Key: " part.
   only the part that i have crossed out here ![API KEY](/screenshots/apiketInfo.jpg)
